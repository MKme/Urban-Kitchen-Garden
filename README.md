# Urban-Kitchen-Garden
This is the repository for the Arduino Urban Kitchen Garden Project

Open Source Arduino controlled counter-top garden for growing vegetables, herbs, or greens for sustainable foods right in your own home.

This project is designed to allow anyone, anywhere to have a modular, aesthetically pleasing, and simple device to grow food in their own kitchen. 

Having long enjoyed growing my own food I searched for a commercial unit to allow me to grow vegetables , herbs and micro-greens/sprouts year round. I found commercial products to significantly lack the control and enclosed-nature I desired to grow what I want, when I want without buying their proprietary seeds/pods/modules. 

It uses a peltier driven wine cooler into a grow chamber and powered it with a simple Arduino for control. The LCD displays the relevant parameters (or alarms) at a glance. 

The unit can control the temp, monitor humidity and soil moisture for any plants. A simple LED spotlight provides sufficient light. 

Hopefully this open-source build will inspire others to grow their own food at home. Perhaps this will allow anyone to achieve some self-reliance for a brighter future regardless of where they may be.

March2019- Updated to include RTC set code.  Edit settings for the current time at programming your RTC, upload, then upload the main Garden code and you time will be displayed correctly.
